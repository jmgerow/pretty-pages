			<h3>Directions:</h3>
			<h2>To make the crust:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Preheat the oven to 375°F.</li>
				<li>Remove the core of the apples, cutting to within a half-inch of the bottom of the apple and creating a well roughly 3/4-inch wide. This is easy to do with an apple corer, but can also be done with a melon baller, grapefruit spoon, or a paring knife.</li>
				<li>Place the brown sugar, oatmeal, cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves in a medium bowl and stir to combine. Divide this mixture between the apples, packing the wells firmly.</li>
				<li>Arrange the apples in a baking dish (like an 8x8-inch Pyrex dish), and top each one with a pat of butter. Pour the water into the bottom of the dish and cover loosely with aluminum foil.</li> 
				<li>Bake for 20 minutes. Uncover and continue baking until the apples are soft and the brown sugar has melted into a syrup, 20 to 30 minutes more. You can test the apples by poking a paring knife through the oatmeal mixture and into the interior of the apple; it should slide into the apple easily with no resistance. The skin on the apples will also become wrinkled and soft by the end of cooking. Serve with a scoop of ice cream, crème fraîche, or whipped cream.</li>
