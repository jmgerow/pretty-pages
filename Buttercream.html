				<ul>
					<li>300ml (1 cup plus 3 tablespoons)  milk of choice – cow, soy, almond…</li>

					<li>750g (6 sticks) unsalted butter, vegan butter or block margarine (note: no spreadable types, must set *hard* when refrigerated), room temperature</li>

			<h3>Directions:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Ensure  that  all  ingredients  are  at  room  temperature  before  starting.  Pour the milk, protein powder and powdered sugar into a jug and combine until the powders are melted.</li>
				<li>Place the butter in a stand mixer.   Using the  whip attachment, start  on low to soften the butter, and slowly pour in your liquid.  Build up to high speed and beat until  all  of the  ingredients are well  combined.  The  mixture  will  go through the  familiar  Swiss  buttercream stages, first appearing curdled, then lumpy, then beginning to smooth and aerate  but  still  tasting like sweetened butter.   At this point switch to a paddle attachment.</li>
				<li>Your buttercream will finally reach a  light, fluffy and voluminous  mixture  which tastes  like whipped cream or vanilla ice cream.  This  should take  around 7-10 minutes in total.  Use  as  you would traditional  Swiss  buttercream.</li>
			<ol>
			<h3>Notes*</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Temperature is crucial! Too cold and the mixture will take forever- like 45 minutes on high – to combine, and will keep climbing the edges of the bowl.  Too warm and you have butter soup.  Ensure your ingredients are all between 22-25 degrees C to make sure they whip up nicely!</li>
				<li>Protein powder is used to substitute the protein from egg whites.</li>
				<li>If you live in a different country or can’t buy these protein powders, you can use any pure, unflavoured, soluble protein powder with more than 70% protein content per 100g.  To see a few protein powders that don’t work, watch the end of the video about protein powder substitutions, here.  Examples of what don’t work are protein shakes, pea, almond, hemp protein powders, egg replacers, cornstarch – any of these will make your buttercream grainy or weird tasting.</li>
				<li>Some icing/ powdered sugar contains cornstarch.  While some people don’t notice it, this does lead to a very slightly grainy texture to the buttercream.  Please use one which is free of cornstarch, or grind your own from regular sugar.   In the UK I use Silver Spoon or Aldi brand icing sugars, both of which don’t contain any (NB: cornflour/ cornstarch is sometimes listed as modified maize starch, or an E number between E1400-1500).</li>
				<li>If not using real butter do make sure you have a true block type butter substitute.  It must set absolutely solid in the fridge to work right, like butter does.   You should be able to poke it firmly with your finger and not leave a dent in the chilled block.  Do NOT use margarine out of a tub or anything you can spread directly from the fridge, like Flora, Vitalite, Pure spreads and so on, or a spreadable shortening like Crisco, as the buttercream will stay too soft to work with as I show in my videos.  I have had countless queries from people asking why their vegan or dairy free buttercream is too soft, only to find they used a spreadable margarine because they couldn’t find butter substitute in a solid block.</li>
